## Design

### Colour Scheme
- I want to keep the colour scheme simple so will be sticking with black, white with different shades of grey. This is because the uploaded pictures from users could be any hosts of colours, so by keeping the colour scheme simple I wont be clashing with any images uploaded which then keeps the images of food the main focus of the user.
### Typography
- On the site I will be using the default bootstrap fonts as I find them clean, elegant and easy to read so feel they will fit in with the sites theme nicely.
### Imagery
- All the imagery will be food related with only 4 images being static. The rest will be uploaded by various users.
